## Simple Build with Makefile using GCC

This project includes a `Makefile` to streamline the build process with `gcc`. Instead of manually typing out lengthy `gcc` commands, you can compile the program quickly by simply running `make`.

### How to Use:
1. Ensure the `Makefile` is in the same directory as your source code.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Type `make` and hit Enter to build the project.
4. Use `make clean` to remove compiled files (if specified in the `Makefile`)
